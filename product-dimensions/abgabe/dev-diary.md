# Pretotype "Cap of a thermos flask"

## Plan/Ambitions:

Imitate the mechanism of the open button that's directly above the 

Build rectangular/pointy frameworks and somehow add the round edges later

![picture of mouth and scribble](./pictures/mouth.jpg)

Imitate the lever mechanism and maybe depending on how its going imitate the pumping mechanism

## Steps

1. Cut out two circles to build the inner support ![picture of two cut out circles](./pictures/circles.jpg)

2. Build a cross-like support to connect both circles, making them top and bottom, also put a smaller circle inside, that lets it keep the right angle ![cross with support](./pictures/cross_on_bottom.jpg)

3. Realize that its really difficult to make a T-Joint on the thin edges of cardboard, cut out 4 support pieces, which will provide more surface area to glue onto ![t-joint supports](./pictures/t_joints_on.jpg)

4. Put top and bottom together ![top bottom and support](./pictures/top_and_bottom_glued.jpg)

5. Roll and trace the cone shaped framework over a cardboard to get the shape of the skin

6. wrap it over the framework and glue it to the supports ![skin_over_framework](./pictures/skin_on_framework.jpg)

7. Decide there is not enough time and profieciency to emulate the round corners and abstract it all into pointy frameworks

8.
