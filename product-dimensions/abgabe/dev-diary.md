# Pretotype "Cap of a thermos flask"

## Task I
### Plan/Ambitions:

Imitate the mechanism of the open button that's directly above the 

Build rectangular/pointy frameworks and somehow add the round edges later

Imitate the lever mechanism and maybe depending on how its going imitate the pumping mechanism

### Steps

1. Cut out two circles to build the inner support ![picture of two cut out circles](./pictures/circles.jpg)

2. Build a cross-like support to connect both circles, making them top and bottom, also put a smaller circle inside, that lets it keep the right angle ![cross with support](./pictures/cross_on_bottom.jpg)

3. Realize that its really difficult to make a T-Joint on the thin edges of cardboard, cut out 4 support pieces, which will provide more surface area to glue onto ![t-joint supports](./pictures/t_joints_on.jpg)

4. Put top and bottom together ![top bottom and support](./pictures/top_and_bottom_glued.jpg)

5. Roll and trace the cone shaped framework over a cardboard to get the shape of the skin

6. wrap it over the framework and glue it to the supports ![skin_over_framework](./pictures/skin_on_framework.jpg)

7. Decide there is not enough time and profieciency to emulate the round corners and abstract it all into pointy shapes

8. Build the mouhtpiece, this was refreshnigly easy as a box shape

9. Glue the mouthpiece to a piece of bent cardboard to make the connection easier with glue

10. Cut out the handle, i tried to be smart by calculating all kinds of triangles but i ended up messing it up and it had some kind of curve, this wasnt planned but the original shape is pretty curve so i took it as a happy accident

11. build a support for the handle, and attach it with the letter clamps to emulate the mechanism

12. Glue it all together for the final product ![complete_thing](./pictures/complete.jpg)

### Reflect

As i had no experience in crafts with cardboard I learnt some basic techniques and properties of it, some of which i like and some that i dislike.

My conclusion is, that it's a great way to quickly aid as a prop or 3D-scribble to communicate ideas and tackle ideas.

## Task II

I filmed my mothers usual morning routine to analyze the process.

The first thing i quickly realized, as i know my mother and her morning routine, that she behaved very differently as soon as i turned on the camera and she was observed.

So in my analysis i did not necessarily inspected every frame of the video but rather what i already know about her morning coffee routine, i additionally interviewed her and found out a bunch of stuff you couldnt see in the video, such as the annoying maintenance aspects
