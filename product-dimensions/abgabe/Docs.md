# Pretotype "Cap of a thermos flask"

## Task I
### Plan/Ambitions:

Imitate the mechanism of the open button that's directly above the


Build rectangular/pointy frameworks and somehow add the round edges later
as

Imitate the lever mechanism and maybe depending on how its going imitate the pumping mechanism

### Steps

1. Cut out two circles to build the inner support  
    ![picture of two cut out circles](./pictures/circles.jpg)

2. Build a cross-like support to connect both circles, making them top and bottom, also put a smaller circle inside, that lets it keep the right angle

3. Realize its difficult to make a t-joint on the thing edges of the cardboard, so use tape to build supports

4. Put top and bottom together

5. Roll and trace the cone shaped framework over a cardboard to get the shape of the skin  

6. wrap it over the framework and glue it to the supports

7. Decide there is not enough time and profieciency to emulate the round corners and abstract it all into pointy shapes  

8. Build the mouhtpiece, this was refreshnigly easy as a box shape  

9. Glue the mouthpiece to a piece of bent cardboard to make the connection easier with glue

10. Cut out the handle, i tried to be smart by calculating all kinds of triangles but i ended up messing it up and it had some kind of curve, this wasnt planned but the original shape is pretty curve so i took it as a happy accident

11. build a support for the handle, and attach it with the letter clamps to emulate the mechanism

12. Glue it all together for the final product

### Reflect

As i had no experience in crafts with cardboard I learnt some basic techniques and properties of it, some of which i like and some that i dislike.

My conclusion is, that it's a great way to quickly aid as a prop or 3D-scribble to communicate ideas and tackle ideas.

## Task II

I filmed my mothers usual morning routine to analyze the process.

The first thing i quickly realized, as i know my mother and her morning routine, is that she behaved very differently as soon as i turned on the camera.

So i dont know how helpful the video was in the end but luckily i knew my mother and her morning routine , i also interviewed her and found out a bunch of stuff that bothered her, that you couldnt see in the video, such as the annoying maintenance aspects

## Task III

### FACM - Fully Automated Coffee Maker

My initial Plan was to improve the fully automatic coffee maker, and make it live up to it's name and make ever single aspect about it automatic.

I started by writing down certain problems my mother had with her machine and sketched some products that would solve these problems with the hope of eventually combining those in one product

I drew up a mindmap together with Freddy and Adrian, to look at advantages and disadvantages in a FAMCM, assuming a persons wishes are simply to get their routine coffee in the most hassle-free way possible, without compromising on quality.

TODO: mindmap image here.

After doing a little design theater with just cardboard boxes i realized i didn't really want to do a fully autonomous or automatic FAMCM-roboter-ai-machine-terminator, it just didn't feel good and i felt like i was tackling too many problems at once.

### Blockchain in the Coffee Supply Chain

So i was back to the drawing board and luckily i talked to Mario about his ideas and since he is kind of a blockchain enthusiast (me too, to some degree), it didnt surprise me that he was looking at some application of the blockchain in this coffee-drinking process. We quickly found numerous articles about the application of the blockchain in the supply chain. So i've decided to work together with Mario, and then Erik and Tamara joined our group also.

First we had one big open discussion in which we brainstormed abit with bullet points in word document, kind of like a less structured mindmap, this was mainly to spark discussions and get on the same page.
The conclusion of this was that the group cared most about making the process transparent for the consumer
and indirectly improving sustainability. We did not much care about profit maximizing, which is also something the blockchain can accomplish in the supplychain.

Very quickly it was evident that our interface to the coffee drinkers was buying the coffee.
We had to choose between:
- Drinking coffee in a cafe/restaurant
- Buying coffee in a supermarket
- Buying coffee online

For our pretotype we chose the supermarket setting, because this is were all of us buy our coffee.

The information you always have in every supermarket is the packet of the coffee that you're buying.
That is why coffee brands print alot of info on the product, such as nutrition data and also origin of the coffee and various seals and certificates. Some of these infos are required by law and some aren't

So this is where i made some sketches of potential coffee packet designs that show infos saved on the blockchain.
Here it was important, that we have some kind of link between the coffee on the blockchain and the coffee package.

There also needed to be a second interface, that curious customers can use to verify the claims made on the coffee and also look at infos that you cannot print on the coffee packge, because it either isnt available at the time of producing it or is just too much.

So i also sketched 3 different UI's you could display these infos

On Wednesday i sadly had to work, but my amazing team made a survey with the sketches and we used that as guidance to which designs/infos we use going forward

This resulted in the following pretotypes that we then used in the Soll-Video.

## Conclusion PROD - Product Dimensions

Task I was fun and i learnt some Cardboard tricks, however i feel like my main learnings were definetly in Task III.

I had alot of fun working on Task III with very cool team members, working up to the video and filming it was very fun. We were all very different in our methods and ideas, which was an advantage and disadvantage at the same time. Have we had more time together i am sure it would have been more of an advantage.

Every now and then and we got hung up on small things and in my opinion we should not have made a PDF mockup of the web-interface.

I also realized it is easier to kill your own babies than killing someone elses. When someone else shows you a pretotype they made and it looks like they put alot of time in it, which happened in our case, i did not want to disrespect this time and just accepted it, when i think i had wanted to try other ideas as well.

I also wanted to try the 3 - 6 - 5 method, for both the FACM, and the blockchain thing but in the first case i 
did not find enough people to do it with me and in the second case we had a clear vision too quickly to consider.

All in all i am happy with my own results and the results of our team!
